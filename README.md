# [FullstackOpen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) Course Exercise Log

FullstackOpen is a course by the University of Helsinki that covers React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript.

This repository acts as a log to keep track of what I have completed in the course and a way for others to view my progress and solutions.

The commit history shows the exercise number and their respective code. Each exercise submission are based on what I learned up to the point of the course (i.e. my code will not contain topics that are yet to be covered even though they might provide a more efficient solution).
